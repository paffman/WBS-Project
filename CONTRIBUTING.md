#How to contribute
First of all, thanks for considering to contribute to this project. Please be sure you understand the terms of our license before making any changes.

To save yourself time, create an issue on this project before you begin development, to discuss your proposed change makes sense. This issue should describe the bug you're going to fix or the feature you want to add thoroughly. 

To contribute you need a Github account to fork this repository and clone this new copy. You'd then create a topic branch (e.g. 
`translation/spanish`) from the current master branch. You can then make your changes and commit them following a *one issue one commit* theme (Protip: Read up on `git rebase -i`). Please make sure your code is valid to the *code conventions* and if writing a ui element compliant to our *MVC design pattern* (see the wiki).

Push the branch to your fork and start a pull request on Github, referencing the issue you created earlier. We will then look through your changes and merge them if they're working.
